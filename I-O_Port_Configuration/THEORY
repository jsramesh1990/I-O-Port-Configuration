THEORY EXPLANATION
8051 I/O Port Architecture:
The 8051 has 4 I/O ports (P0, P1, P2, P3) with 8 bits each. Each port can be configured as input or output. When configured as input, the port needs external pull-up resistors. When configured as output, it can sink current (better for driving LEDs).

Bitwise Operations Explained:
AND (&): Used to clear/mask bits

c
port = port & 0xFE;  // Clear bit 0 (11111110)
OR (|): Used to set bits

c
port = port | 0x01;  // Set bit 0 (00000001)
XOR (^): Used to toggle bits

c
port = port ^ 0x01;  // Toggle bit 0
Shift (<<, >>): Used for patterns and multiplication/division by 2

c
pattern = pattern << 1;  // Shift left (multiply by 2)
Port Configuration Principles:
Writing 1 to a port pin makes it input (high impedance)

Writing 0 to a port pin makes it output (can sink current)

For LED driving, configure as output and write 0 to turn ON

For button reading, configure as input and use pull-up resistors
