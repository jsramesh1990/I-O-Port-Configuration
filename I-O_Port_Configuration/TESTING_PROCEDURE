TESTING PROCEDURE
Test Case 1: Basic I/O Configuration
c
Expected Result: LED connected to P1.0 should toggle every second
Test Procedure:
1. Program microcontroller with basic I/O test
2. Observe LED behavior
3. Measure voltage on P1.0 pin
4. Verify timing with oscilloscope
Test Case 2: Bitwise Operations
c
Test Pattern: 0xAA (10101010) followed by 0x55 (01010101)
Expected: Alternating LED pattern
Measurement: Use logic analyzer to capture port data
Test Case 3: Button Input
c
Test: Press each button individually
Expected: Corresponding LED should light up
Verification: Check port reading vs button state
Test Case 4: Knight Rider Pattern
c
Expected: LED scanning left to right and back
Timing: Each LED should be ON for 100ms
Verification: Pattern should repeat continuously

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
Common Issues and Solutions:
LEDs not lighting up:

Check LED polarity (anode to port, cathode to ground through resistor)

Verify 5V power supply

Check if port pins are configured as output (write 0 to port)

Measure voltage on port pins (should be ~0V for ON, ~5V for OFF)

Buttons not responding:

Verify pull-up resistors are connected

Check for proper debouncing in software

Test continuity with multimeter

Ensure button connects pin to ground when pressed

Programming failure:

Verify COM port selection in Flash Magic

Check USB-UART driver installation

Ensure correct baud rate (usually 2400 for 8051)

Verify RESET circuit is working

Timing issues:

Adjust delay functions for crystal frequency

Use oscilloscope to measure pulse widths

Consider using timer interrupts for precise timing
